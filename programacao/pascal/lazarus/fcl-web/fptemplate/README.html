<p>This is the beginning of a server side web system for FPC.
Although it is non-visual, it is geared towards use in Lazarus.</p>
<p>NOTE: the template support (fptemplate unit) was moved to
fcl-base. See the fcl-base/texts/fptemplate.txt file.</p>
<p>Architecture:</p>
<h2 id="httpprotocol">httpprotocol:</h2>
<p>Mostly standard HTTP header definitions, and some auxiliary routines.</p>
<h2 id="httpdefs">httpdefs</h2>
<p>contains the basic HTTP system definitions:
header field names
TCookie(s):
collection with cookies in web request
TUploadedFile(s):
collection with uploaded files in request
THTTPHeader:<br>
Class describes HTTP Request/Response headers.
it has properties for all possible HTTP headers, including cookies
TRequest:
Descendent of THTTPHeader, describes client request.
Contains uploaded files.
TResponse:
describes the web server response. Includes headers and contents.
TCustomSession:
Base for all session components.</p>
<h2 id="httproute">httproute</h2>
<p>The old Delphi style routing worked with Datamodules only. The pattern was
strictly /modulename/actionname or through query variables: ?module=xyz&amp;Action=nmo</p>
<p>This old routing is still available by setting the LegacyRouting property of
webhandler or webapplication (custweb) to true. (the new routing described
below is then disabled)</p>
<p>The new routing is more flexible in 3 ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is no longer required to use datamodules, but this is still supported.
There are now 4 methods that can be used to register a route:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using a callback procedure
TRouteCallback = Procedure(ARequest: TRequest; AResponse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a callback event:
TRouteEvent = Procedure(ARequest: TRequest; AResponse) of object;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using an interface
IRouteInterface = Interface ['{10115353-10BA-4B00-FDA5-80B69AC4CAD0}']
Procedure HandleRequest(ARequest : TRequest; AResponse : TResponse);
end;
Note that this is a CORBA interface, so no reference counting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a router object:
TRouteObject = Class(TObject,IRouteInterface)
Public
Procedure HandleRequest(ARequest : TRequest; AResponse : TResponse); virtual; abstract;
end;
TRouteObjectClass = Class of TRouteObject;
The object class needs to be registered. The router will instantiate the
object and release it once the request was handled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More methods can be added, if need be.
All routes are registered using the HTTPRouter.RegisterRoute method.
it is overloaded to accept any of the above parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The router can now match more complex, parametrized routes.</p>
<p>A route is the path part of an URL; query parameters are not examined.</p>
<p>/path1/path2/path3/path4</p>
<p>In these paths, parameters and wildcards are recognized:
:param means that it will match any request with a single part in this location
*paramm means that it will match any request with zero or more path parts in this location</p>
<p>examples:</p>
<p>/path1<br>
/REST/:Resource/:ID
/REST/:Resource
/*/something
/*path/somethiingelse
/*path</p>
<p>The parameters will be added to TRequest, they are available in the (new) RouteParams array property of TRequest.</p>
<p>Paths are matched case sensitively by default, and the first matching pattern is used.</p>
<p>HTTP Modules are registered in the router using classname/* or defaultmodulename/*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of methods can be added to the route registration (default is to  accept all methods).
The router will  match the request method. If the method does not match, it will raise an
exception which will result in a 405 HTTP error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fphttp">fphttp:</h2>
<p>Basic web system components/classes</p>
<p>TCustomHTTPModule:

TModuleFactory/TModuleItem:
Module registration and creation system.
TCustomWebAction(s):
Webactions.
RegisterHTTPModule():
routine registers a module with the web system.
THTTPContentProducer :

<p>The idea is that the URL relative to the server is taken and parsed as
follows
<a href="http://www.server.org/Path1/Path2">http://www.server.org/Path1/Path2</a></p>
<p>Path1 determines which module in the system is created to handle the
request. (the factory is queried)
Path2 determines which web action inside the module is used to handle the
request. (implemented in TWebModule, see fpweb)</p>
<h2 id="websession">websession</h2>

<h2 id="custcgi">custcgi:</h2>
<p>CGI application base class. It knows nothing of the fp
HTTP module system.</p>
<p>TCustomCGIApplication :

environment.</p>

to create a TCustomHTTPModuleClass to handle the request.</p>
<p>It contains an Application instance which handles everything.</p>
<h2 id="fpapache">fpApache:</h2>
<p>Apache Module support.</p>
<p>TCustomApacheApplication:
Uses fpweb to create TCustomHTTPModuleClass instances to
handle the request.</p>
<h2 id="fphttpclient">fphttpclient:</h2>
<p>HTTP Protocol client component</p>
<p>TFPCustomHTTPClient:
A component which can be used to communicate with a HTTP Server. It can
execute HTTP GET and POST methods out of the box, but can be used to execute
other HTTP methods as well. It works using the ssockets unit of FPC, so no
third-party package to handle the socket communication is needed.</p>
<p>The class contains class methods, which allow to execute get/post methods in a really
simple, one-command way.</p>
<p>A demo application for this class exists.</p>
<h2 id="fphttpserver">fphttpserver:</h2>
<p>TFPCustomHttpServer:
A Component which can be used to create a simple HTTP Server. All requests
are routed through a OnRequest handler. The request and responses are
modeled using the fpWeb TRequest and TResponse objects from httpdefs. The
class itself does not serve files. The OnRequest handler must be
implemented to actually serve files or respond to requests.
It can work threaded or non-threaded.
It works using the ssockets unit of FPC, so no third-party package to
handle the socket communication is needed.</p>
<p>A demo application for this class exists.</p>
<h2 id="custhttpapp">custhttpapp:</h2>
<p>Integration of TFPCustomHttpServer in a TWebApplication.</p>
<p>TFPHTTPServerHandler:

object for stand-alone HTTP applications. It can be used as a parent
component for standalone HTTP application objects.</p>
<h2 id="fphttpapp">fphttpApp:</h2>
<p>THTTPApplication:
A descendent of TCustomHTTPApplication. It does nothing except expose
properties which exist in TCustomHTTPApplication. A global instance of
this class is defined in fphttpApp. Use this unit and class if you want a
simple standalone http server application for test purposes.</p>
<p>A demo application for this class exists.</p>
<h2 id="fpwebfile">fpwebfile:</h2>
<p>Used to implement file serving.</p>
<p>TFPCustomFileModule:
TFPCustomHTTPModule descendant which will serve files. Can be used as-is,
but descendents can be made to implement e.g. logging, authorisation etc.
must not be registered directly, register locations using the RegisterFileLocation
call.</p>
