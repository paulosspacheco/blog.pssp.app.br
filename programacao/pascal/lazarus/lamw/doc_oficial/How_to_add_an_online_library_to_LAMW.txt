A complete tutorial (from image1 to image34) how to add an "online" library to LAMW [create a new jComponent]!!!

WARNING: the "datalogic"  APIs tested in LAMW demo code returned nothing (nil)...

In fact the library source code pointed by Android Studio is clearly returning null in several APIs....

But the tutorial is OK !!!!
