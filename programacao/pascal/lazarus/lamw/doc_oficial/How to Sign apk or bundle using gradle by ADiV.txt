"With the latest LAMW update we can sign our apk or bundle more easily:

First we will execute "release-keystore" if we do not have the signature created.

Then we will fill in the signature file "gradle.properties" as follows:

RELEASE_STORE_FILE = yourapp.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD = yourpassword
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS = yourappaliaskey
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD = yourpassword

And to finish we close and open the project and it will automatically include the signature."
